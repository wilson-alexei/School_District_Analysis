# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 Challenge is utilizing 'Python','Jupyter Notebook', & 'Pandas'

## Overview of the school district analysis 
Due to evidences of academic dishonesty by the ninth graders in Thomas High School, the school board has notified and requested Maria to redo the school district analysis by replacing ninth-grade reading and math scores to a "NaN" or "Not a Number". We also need to exclude Thomas High School's ninth-graders from the school district analysis to create a more accurate outcome and write a report for the analysis. 

The school district analysis will include: 
  * District Summary
  * School Summary
  * Top and Bottom 5 Performing Schools, based on the overall passing rate
  * Average Math Score from each grade level from each school 
  * Average Reading Score from each grade level from each school
  * Scores by School Spending per Student, School Size, and School Type
